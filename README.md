Tech: React with React Hooks, React Router with authenticated routes, Firebase Auth, Firestore, Material UI.

Extras: Infinite scroll for pokemon list, pokemon gifs for better visuals, ability to go back to top when scrolling. Authentication is done by Firebase authentication. Favorite pokemons are stored in firestore. Firestore database design was made by myself.

If you want to check the app online I have deployed it on netlify: https://zen-aryabhata-d63522.netlify.com/

Opening the file lighthouse.html you can check the lighthouse metrics/benchmarks of the project. Even though I sacrificed performance for visuals(pokemon gifs) the app performs good.

If you want to run the app locally, I kept my firebase credentials in the code on Google Drive therefore you can run the application with firebase.

To run first install dependencies;

```
yarn or npm install
```

Then start the app

```
yarn start or npm start
```
